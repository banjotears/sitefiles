<p>A visual novel for PC built with a team of six over eight months that explores the roles we play for those around us and the intimacy of truly knowing someone beneath their surface projections.<br> 
  Curtain Call <b>explores</b> modern societal expectations and pressures, as well as the <u>courage</u> and <u>strength</u> it takes to break through them.</p>

<p>For dates, I started with the location first, discussing with my team where a good location to set the date would be. <br>
  After that, I would draft the date in Word before beginning writing in Yarn Spinner. After my first draft, I iterated based on feedback from my teammates and playtesters.</p>

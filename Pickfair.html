<p>An Alternate Reality Game (ARG)-like developed with fellow students<br>
and staff at the University of Southern California.</p>
<img src="Site Files/shall we play a game.png">
<p>Created for incoming freshmen at the School of Cinematic Arts, it follows the story<br>
of a rogue AI called Elysee Reinhardt and a mysterious organization known as the Pickfair Directive.</p>

<p>By solving puzzles and making creative works, players can meet SCA alumni and gain access to special events.</p>
<img src="Site Files/catv.PNG">
<p>We showcased student projects on Twitch via a "pirate Twitch channel" and gave students a space to<br>
discuss their art and how they relate to the world around them.</p>

<p>During my time on the project I:<br>
-Participated in weekly meetings with the rest of the design team consisting of<br>
3 lead designers and 4 other gamemasters<br>
-Created puzzles, ciphers, and challenges for players<br> 
-Roleplayed as characters involved in the ARG on platforms including Twitter and Discord</p>

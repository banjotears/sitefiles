<p>A high energy action platformer developed for the USC Games Advanced Game Project.<br> 
A dark satire of the "plight of the solo dev," <br>

<p>As lead narrative designer, I kept the narrative team on track,<br> 
ensuring the game's tone and style matched the director's vision.

<p>Alongside leading the narrative team, I kept and updated a document for all scripted dialogue.<br>
Other team members added to/edited the script, but the director, Adam Morina, and I<br>
had final say on what was included in the current script.

After finalizing out script, I sat in with our director and VO director,<br>
giving necessary context to our actors when needed, as we recorded lines both remotely and asynchronously.
